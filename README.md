# 🤖 Want a whatsapp bot? You're in the right place.

# 📖 Introduction

A high-level Python wrapper for the WhatsApp API, providing easy abstraction.

A huge thanks to the [Pyton-Telegram-Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) team for their impressive work on Telegram bots, which inspired me to create this wrapper.

# 📱 Whatsapp API Supports

Tested in version `v19.0`, but you can try older versions by changing `api_version` on creating object.

# 🛠️ Before start

Before you can create your own bots, you need to follow some steps to become a `Meta API Developer`.  
**YOU NEED**  to become a Meta developer to use their API. You can find the step-by-step guide here: [Facebook Developers WhatsApp API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/)  
It's preferable to have an extra SIM card to register your business account (don't try with your personal SIM, this action will **ERASE** all your whatsapp data), but they give you some free credits to get started.

# 🚀 Installation

We're on PyPI! So you can easy install using:

```sh
pip install python-whatsapp-wrapper
```

Or directly by cloning from the GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sergio-Daniel-Pires/python-whatsapp-wrapper
cd python-whatsapp-wrapper
pip install .
```

# 🤔 How I made my own bot?


Our repository contains many examples that you can just click-and-run. Maybe you want to try the `echobot`, a chat bot that reverses everything you send with the command `/echo this message`.
