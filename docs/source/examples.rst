Examples
========

This is a section dedicated to show examples of how to use the library.
Examples are good to show how to use the library in a practical way, but no good for
use as real project, because theres no WSGI, no isolated context,
error handling, no tests, no documentation, etc.

------------------------
Like a Hello World for chatbots, this example shows how to create a
simple bot that echoes the user text input.
